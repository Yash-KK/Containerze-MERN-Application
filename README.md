## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- **`server`**: Contains the backend code (Node.js + Express).
- **`client`**: Contains the frontend code (React).

## Running the Application Locally

### Step 1: Start the Backend Server

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd mern/server
  
2. Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install

```

### Step 2: Start the Frontend Server

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
